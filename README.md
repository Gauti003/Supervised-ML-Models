   ***Classifiction and Regression***
 
       1. Classification ( discrete value outputs / Categorical )
                a.  Logistic Regression
                b.  Decision Trees
                c.  Random Forest
                d.  Support vector Machines
                
               In Classification, the goal is to pedict the class labels from a predefined list of possibilities of examples.
               eg: cat/not cat, men/women, good/bad 
                
       2. Regression (Continuous Value Outputs)
                a.  Linear Regression
                b.  Regression Trees
                c.  Non-Linear Regression
                d.  Bayesian Linear Regression
                e.  Polynomial Regression
                
                In Regression the goal is to predict continous number or a floating point number.
                eg: Predecting House prices, salaries , Yield etc.. 
                
   ***Differentiating between Classification and Regression Problems***
   
      Check for continuity or discrete in the outout.
